'Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator' project from Udacity's SQL Nanodegree program

The project is about investigating a poorly designed database for Udiddit, a social news aggregator. I designed a new, normalized and performant database and migrate over data from the previous database.

Specific tasks involved:
Part I: Investigate the existing schema
Part II: Create the DDL for your new schema
Part III: Migrate the provided data
